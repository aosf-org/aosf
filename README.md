# AOSF — Agentic Open Source Foundation

> Neutral, transparent governance for AI-generated open source software — ensuring quality, security, and ethical standards for the vibe coding era.

## About

AOSF is the first open source foundation purpose-built for the age of AI-generated code. We bridge the gap between the explosive growth of AI-generated software and the governance, security, and quality frameworks needed to make it trustworthy.

## Five Core Functions

1. **Vibe-Coded Project Repository** — Curated home for AI-generated open source projects with automated security scanning, AI provenance tracking, and quality tiers (Experimental → Validated → Production-Ready → Enterprise-Certified)
2. **Rust Migration Initiative** — AI-assisted translation of critical C/C++ infrastructure to memory-safe Rust
3. **Agentic-Native Operations** — Agent-assisted code review, automated documentation, transparent audit trails with DAO-hybrid governance
4. **Ethical AI Development Standards** — Attribution, licensing, and human-in-the-loop frameworks for AI-generated code
5. **CELLO Leaderboard** — 100% open-source LLM code evaluation benchmark with reproducible methodology

## Research
